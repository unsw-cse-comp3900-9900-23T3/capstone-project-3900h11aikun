Week1 diary:

Group formed. I read through all the project topics before our first meeting. I joined first group online meeting, and discussed which project to choose with group mates.

Week2 diary:
We decided how to split proposal work in this week's lab meeting. 
I am going to draw interface and flow diagrams.

Week3 diary:
We discussed user story in online meetings, I draw the first version of story boards by Figma,
including user log in and user register interface.
After user story in proposal is written, I draw the rest of story boards,
including user profile, home page, user projects page and so on.
When I met some problem or considerations about user story, I chatted with groupmates in group chat,
and did some modification to the story boards.
